# Lang

Basic compiler for a custom language minimal functionality. Expect bugs. There is no documentation, I'd recommend looking at the examples.

Only tested on linux x86-64

You can run with the following.

```sh
# This will run the compiler and output the binary "out"
cargo r -r -- build examples/hello.lang

# Run the outputted program
./out
```
